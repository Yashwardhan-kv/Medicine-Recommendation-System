# Medicine-Recommendation-System
Project Name: Medicine Recommendation System

# Overview:
The Medicine Recommendation System is designed to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions about medication choices for patients. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and patient data, the system offers personalized recommendations while minimizing adverse effects and drug interactions.

# Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collects patient data including medical history, symptoms, and allergies, and preprocesses it for analysis.
Model Training: Utilizes Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms to train models on the dataset.
Backend Development: Implements APIs using Flask to handle data requests and provide medication recommendations based on input data.
Frontend Development: Develops a user-friendly interface using React for healthcare providers to input patient data and receive medication recommendations.
Database Schema: Designs a MySQL database schema to store patient information and recommended medications.

# Technologies Used:

Python (Scikit-learn, Flask)
React.js
MySQL
GitHub for version control and project management

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to enhance healthcare delivery by providing evidence-based medication choices tailored to individual patient needs and conditions. By integrating advanced algorithms with comprehensive patient data, the system aims to optimize treatment plans and improve patient outcomes.

# Deployment:
The system is designed to be deployed on a web server, with the frontend and backend components communicating via RESTful APIs. It utilizes Docker for containerization and can be easily scaled based on healthcare provider needs.

# Future Enhancements:
Future enhancements may include integrating natural language processing (NLP) for better symptom analysis, incorporating real-time patient monitoring data, and enhancing the user interface for improved usability and accessibility.
